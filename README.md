# BoardGameGeek Data Thing

Just for funsies.

Uses InquirerPy to create a very basic interactive BGG data reader/finder with their XML API.

I'm sure there are more efficient ways to do some of the things I'm doing in here. And that's okay.
I'll chip away at improvements and updates over time. :)

## Requirements

You can use pip to install the requirements in the requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't have pip, you might need to manually install both of these packages:

- InquirerPy
- Requests

At the time of writing, I have the following versions installed:

- InquirerPy 0.3.4
- Requests 2.27.1
